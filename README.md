# DATA ANALYTICS STUDENT

My name is Simone Travaglini, I am 25 years old and I am completing the second year of the Master's degree course in Data Analytics for Politics, Society, and Complex Organisations at the University of Milan. 
My academic journey started in the 2018/2019 academic year when I enrolled in the Faculty of Political Science. During this period, I developed significant skills in social research.

My ever-growing interest in statistics and research subjects led me to enrol in a Master's degree programme in Data Analytics. This choice has allowed me to deepen my knowledge in the field, improving the analytical skills needed to tackle complex challenges in political, social and organisational contexts.

Beyond the academic field, I am constantly striving to develop specific skills that aim to shape my professional future. Currently, I am focusing my education in the field of data science. I have taken advanced courses that have improved my programming skills in R and Python, becoming familiar with techniques such as data scraping, machine learning models, big data and data analysis.
My aspiration is to apply the skills acquired during my studies to tackle complex real-world challenges, contributing significantly to problem solving through data analysis. I am excited to continue exploring and deepening opportunities in this field, leveraging my passion for data analysis and complex problem solving.

## Work experience

My work experience has been characterised by occasional jobs to pay for my studies. Despite this, I can say that I have had stimulating experiences and learned to adapt to different contexts by working in diverse teams.

## Coding and Data Science projects:
In this section you can find some projects that I found stimulating and interesting during my academic years

### Introduction to R: 
In this work I was asked to analyse a dataset of 10000 tweets, over a period of 4 years. i carried out a sentiment analysis, developed linear models and time series. The second part focused on the data collected on spotify:

### Data access: 
In this project, I used the twitter API to analyse the Italian political scenario in the election campaign. With this, I wanted to see the number of tweets and topics used on the social media by the main political coalitions for the Italian general election in 2022:

### Big data analytics: 

Throughout the big data analytics course, we developed text analysis models: starting with defining the analysis corpus, we then developed scaling/scoring and classification models. Through this we used various machine learning models for text classification.
You can find some examples here above:

For this project, I analysed a train-set containing political tweets: the output focuses on the variable 'polite': a dummy variable equal to 1 if a tweet uses 'polite' language; 0 'rude' language. I then trained three machine learning models (naive bayes, support vector machine and random forest) for classification and commented on the results obtained on the test-set.

In this part I trained a train dataset containing a random sample of movie reviews with two different machine learning models (Regularized Regression and
Gradient Boosting) and verified through external validity which was the better of the two. Furthermore, I explored the internal validity of the best model and tested on the validation- and test-set. The outcome focused on the sentiment variable (two levels: negative and positive)

This project, on the other hand, was carried out on a random sample of 5,000 real clothing reviews. First I created a word embedding model. Then I divided the dataset into train- and test-sets to train a support vector machine model: the aim was to predict product liking from the reviews. I then developed the hyperparameters and trained the model, checked the internal validity and tested the model on the test dataset.
