# DATA ANALYTICS STUDENT

My name is Simone Travaglini, I am 25 years old and I am completing the second year of the Master's degree course in Data Analytics for Politics, Society, and Complex Organisations at the University of Milan. 
My academic journey started in the 2018/2019 academic year when I enrolled in the Faculty of Political Science. During this period, I developed significant skills in social research.

My ever-growing interest in statistics and research subjects led me to enrol in a Master's degree programme in Data Analytics. This choice has allowed me to deepen my knowledge in the field, improving the analytical skills needed to tackle complex challenges in political, social and organisational contexts.

Beyond the academic field, I am constantly striving to develop specific skills that aim to shape my professional future. Currently, I am focusing my education in the field of data science. I have taken advanced courses that have improved my programming skills in R and Python, becoming familiar with techniques such as data scraping, machine learning models, big data and data analysis.
My aspiration is to apply the skills acquired during my studies to tackle complex real-world challenges, contributing significantly to problem solving through data analysis. I am excited to continue exploring and deepening opportunities in this field, leveraging my passion for data analysis and complex problem solving.
